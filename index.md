I am a Senior Lecturer and Assistant Director of the [Data Analytics and Policy Program](https://advanced.jhu.edu/directory/sanghoon-kim-leffingwell/) and a Faculty Affiliate at the [SNF Agora Institute](https://snfagora.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University. My research interests focus on how democratic frustration and [authoritarian nostalgia](/pubs/bookproject/) have met with a rise in support for authoritarian alternatives in many new democracies. My regional focus is on East and Southeast Asian democracies. I received my PhD in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022. My research has appeared in *Party Politics*, *Journal of East Asian Studies*, _International Journal of Press/Politics_, *Social Science Quarterly*, and _International Studies Quarterly_.
 
My research has received support from various sources, including a Faculty Grant Award from the [SNF Agora Institute](https://snfagora.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, a [Taiwan Fellowship](https://taiwanfellowship.ncl.edu.tw/eng/index.aspx) from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan, a Doctoral Fellowship from the [Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange](http://www.cckf.org/en/), and multiple institutions at the University of Illinois.
