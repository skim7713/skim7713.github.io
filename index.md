I am a Senior Lecturer and Assistant Director with the Data Analytics and Policy Program at Johns Hopkins University. 
I received my PhD in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022. 
My research interests focus on [authoritarian nostalgia](https://www.sanghoonkim.org/publication/dissertation/bookproject/) 
and related political behavior in post-authoritarian democracies. My regional focus is on South Korea and other Asian democracies. 

My current book project, *The Past that Binds*, provides theoretical and empirical foundations for nostalgic behavior 
and democratic development. I argue that authoritarian nostalgia is an important source of group sentiment in post-authoritarian 
democracies, which produces large and surprising effects on voter attitudes and behaviors. My book will build much needed 
foundations for nostalgic behavior and democratic development by drawing on South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, and the 
Philippines as case studies.
 
My research has received support from various sources, including a Faculty Grant Award from the
[SNF Agora Institute](https://snfagora.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, a
[Taiwan Fellowship](https://taiwanfellowship.ncl.edu.tw/eng/index.aspx) from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan, 
a Doctoral Fellowship from the [Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange](http://www.cckf.org/en/), 
and multiple institutions at the University of Illinois.
