Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unt.edu) at the University of North Texas. My primary research focuses on [authoritarian nostalgia](http://sanghoonkimleffingwell.org/bookproject/) and howit shapes voter behavior in post-authoritarian democracies. I further develop research projects in the intersection of domestic and international politics of China's expansion in Asia. My regional focus is on East Asian and Southeast Asian democracies, including South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, and the Philippines. I introduce various research methods in answering key research questions, including text and image analysis and experiments. I received my PhD in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022 and MA and BA at Korea University. Before joining UNT, I was a Senior Lecturer and Assistant Director of the Data Analytics and Policy Program and a faculty affiliate in the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University. My research has appeared in *Political Behavior*, *Democratization*, *Party Politics*, _International Studies Quarterly_, *World Development*, and _International Journal of Press/Politics_, among others.
