Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unt.edu) at the University of North Texas. My primary research focuses on [authoritarian nostalgia](https://www.sanghoonkim.org/publication/dissertation/bookproject/) and related political behavior in post-authoritarian democracies. I further develop research projects in the intersection of domestic and international politics of China's expansion in Asia. My regional focus is on South Korea and other Asian democracies. I introduce various research methods in answering key research questions, including experiments and text and image analysis. I received my PhD in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022 and MA and BA at Korea University. My research has appeared in *Democratization*, _International Journal of Press/Politics_, _International Studies Quarterly_, *Journal of East Asian Studies*, *Party Politics*, *Social Science Quarterly*, and *World Development*.
