My research explores authoritarian nostalgia and how it shapes voter behavior in post-authoritarian democracies. 
The primary focus of my research is understanding the role of authoritarian nostalgia as a source of social identity 
and its effects on voter behavior. In addition, I have developed a separate research project understanding the political 
economy in East Asia. This work has focused on the expansion of China’s presence in the neighboring countries and how this 
can shape voters’ attitudes toward China. Lastly, from my work on corruption, I have developed an interest in studying factors that can promote political accountability.

- "Authoritarian Nostalgia, Group Sentiment, and Political Behavior"
    - Legacies of an authoritarian past have enduring effects on voters’ attitudes and behaviors. I argue that authoritarian nostalgia is an important source of group sentiment and related behavior in post-authoritarian democracies. Voters with nostalgic sentiment construct heightened social identity connected to the past, exhibit strong group sentiment based on historical perception, and express attachment towards authoritarian successors. I test this argument with a novel measure of authoritarian nostalgia. With original data collected from South Korea and Taiwan, I provide evidence that nostalgic voters are likely to exhibit strong group sentiment observable through partisan attachment. Abstracting from the specific cases, I use a randomly assigned candidate comparison analysis to demonstrate that voters high in authoritarian nostalgia are more attracted to hypothetical candidates evoking nostalgia than those with high programmatic or ideological proximity. Overall, the results show how authoritarian nostalgia remains important as a source of social identity in maturing democracies.
 
- Legacies of Nationalism and Authoritarian Retention
    - Why do voters elect authoritarian successors in some post-authoritarian countries but not in others? And what explains the variation in electoral success of nostalgic rhetoric across countries? This paper answers with a focus on how dictators consolidated symbolic power through nationalism, introducing a political psychological perspective in addition to the conventional focus on political economy. I argue that histories of state-sponsored hierarchical nationalism under dictatorship generate stronger nostalgic voter behavior, while nostalgic rhetoric proves less effective in countries with egalitarian nationalism that emphasizes civic and popular features. I employ multiple empirical approaches to test this main argument. First, I compare the historical trajectories of nationalism formation in four Asian cases of South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, and the Phlilppines and show how varied histories of nationalism are associated with different nostalgic voter behavior in democratic elections. Second, with new cross-national measures of authoritarian legacies and nationalism types, I conduct quantitative analysis across thirty-six Third Wave democracies. Combined results show the importance of cultural and ideological legacies of former dictatorships in voter attitudes and related behavior in post-authoritarian democracies.
