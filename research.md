My research explores authoritarian nostalgia and how it shapes voter behavior in post-authoritarian democracies. 
The primary focus of my research is understanding how democratic frustration and authoritarian nostalgia leads to support for authoritarian alternatives in post-authoritarian countries. In addition, I have developed a separate research project understanding the political economy in East Asia. This work has focused on the expansion of China’s presence in the neighboring countries and how this can shape voters’ attitudes toward China. Lastly, from my work on corruption, I have developed an interest in studying factors that can promote political accountability. 

My research is organized into the following topical areas on this page: 
- Authoritarian nostalgia and political behavior
- Political economy of anti-China protests
- Journalism and political accountability
