My research explores authoritarian nostalgia and how it shapes voter behavior in post-authoritarian democracies. 
The primary focus of my research is understanding the role of authoritarian nostalgia as a source of social identity 
and its effects on voter behavior. In addition, I have developed a separate research project understanding the political 
economy in East Asia. This work has focused on the expansion of China’s presence in the neighboring countries and how this 
can shape voters’ attitudes toward China.
