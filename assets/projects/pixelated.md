### Pixelated Authoritarian Nostalgia: The Use of Nostalgic Rhetoric of Former Dictators in the Media


Democratic transition marks the end of former dictatorships; however, the former authoritarian
regimes still shape voter attitudes and related behavior in many new democracies. Political
elites often revisit and reframe the past in order to construct favorable historical narratives and
win votes in democratic elections. News media play a significant role in this regard, with
conservative media often invoking nostalgia for past dictatorships. This paper explores how
newspapers engage in nostalgic rhetoric and how such media selectively use different images of
former dictators, with a focus on the visual and textual representations. We draw on the case of
South Korea, where nostalgic reference for Park Chung-heeâ€™s dictatorship remains strong across
democratic elections. We collect text and image data from Korean newspapers on the opposite
sides of the ideological spectrum and compare visual and textual rhetoric for Park in four
aspects: the frequency of images depicting him, the variation in visual topics, the verbal
messages associated visual images, and the variation in these features around elections. We
employ semantic image clustering and text topic modeling and answer how newspapers narrate
the past using both visual and textual messages. Findings suggest the lingering polarization in
memory construction in a post-authoritarian country.
